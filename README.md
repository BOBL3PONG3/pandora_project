# pandora_project

Pandora is a tool to analyze flight record data to provide summary and high-level information based on low-level sensor data (e.g., fighter jet position).

Project description

Planes are equipped with Flight Recorder or black box to track many parameters during a flight to help during the investigation of accident. This project aims to emulate a software that would read and extract information from the flight data recorder. We will in this class take some liberties on how the data are stored and extracted to simplify the process.
Flight data records

Records about a flight will be store in a text file. Specifications can be found here
Flight Analysis

The tool will produce multiple flight analyses depending on the output option it receives as a Command Line Option. It can:

    Compute and display a single value (e.g., average altitude during the whole flight), as well as multiple values (e.g., a full report)
    Consider a single file (e.g., the average altitude of a given flight), several files (e.g., the average altitude of each flight), and multiple files (e.g., the maximum average altitude of a flight among others).

Features to Develop

Features are represented by issues open in your git repository. They are organized according to milestones. A list of features and milestones can be found here
